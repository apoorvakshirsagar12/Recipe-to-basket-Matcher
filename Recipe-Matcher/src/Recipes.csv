Place the pan over high heat and bring to a boil. The idea here is to have the water all but evaporate at the same time as the carrots finish cooking, leaving you with a rich and delicious glaze to coat and be poured over the dish. If the water seems to be evaporating before the carrots are close to being done, you can add a little more. At the same time, if the carrots seem to be getting too done, remove them from the pan.  Reduce the glaze, and then at the end, add the carrots back to warm them and to cook the lettuce.', '3. The whole idea here is to have a tender carrot that is not mushy, yet not so hard that when you cut it, it shoots across the table. It is timing, and you can always use a toothpick to test the fattest part of the carrot\xe2\x80\x94it should yield with pressure. As the water gets close to being gone, add the lettuce. Let the lettuce wilt and get soft (this will only take about 30 seconds). You want it to be vibrant green but tender like cooked spinach. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Plate, drizzle the glaze over the veggies and serve.']","['https://images.food52.com/REY6EpFHI70A0Ip-1WArYXpPsD0=/753x502/29249eca-8e56-4a28-9979-28fc265e4d4d--030811F_291.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/Bv-DTYdN3YhrvFP9pMD2k5f05lc=/753x502/e203ae6c-24c9-494b-a6de-8e01aa0b31e0--030811F_170.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/SpYpU8kzHGF3KQOHG_qezltrYuM=/753x502/8a2228b8-9b61-4b65-952c-29ff8e42758a--030811F_287.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/jyVZ8Y5tvgefpF6aWql0GiK8WUg=/753x502/7db63d65-6a2d-48df-a9f7-583ee0aad680--glazed_carrots.jpg', 'https://images.food52.com/JD-hLniheDqeQszgrqq7lH8I9vE=/bd82e615-cc51-4dba-a95e-071ac73dc493--030811F_170.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/ljsTUo36oIOLBIduJWoN1K3ysoI=/7e5459a9-c4b8-4ff1-b979-f4eb82f853f4--030811F_185.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/US4xxlhRUZhRsL0hdsUuFZpjufM=/eae23e05-8b85-40e1-8006-0254e1ab43af--030811F_191.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/C3vIDSARpgiCk5v-VLx7kA_ocFw=/966d98df-99de-42b7-803e-947afba3d106--030811F_187.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/UUdv1cm2kEzIAvHrHoXtNEbnl0o=/04046e2f-9e25-48f1-939e-9118e7fa4a00--030811F_194.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/cb0D6fhomiP24C0KsvNoaCzeQuE=/4453164c-d87a-4819-818b-36c830911330--030811F_199.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/gYQWq3d6svULGd0I7qiQSJD3U-g=/f4c9b6d7-c76d-4a0e-9648-45609f5f48ec--030811F_211.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/r0TSS7tHFCEWxb5W_B7Ip934ymw=/accbcd72-e5ac-40f6-860b-50ef6304ebbd--030811F_213.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/Wd_y84OYWl8D2AyscSbG5eXyQOU=/4473fd31-5a42-42f4-a8b2-0b943cdd290e--030811F_222.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/vcdhI0a76LQBTABXn3vEz8QP7d4=/1b1aa147-3d7f-4226-8708-94cdec08a433--030811F_238.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/YuBD4AJeCa3dZNBycQoAwc0w8p0=/8bb6cc72-cf8c-4408-b26c-2a98872122b7--030811F_268.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/628JHnEgDxEJ8WEPcYNrtFZMQCg=/a5606ab1-7aaa-4bbf-a9b7-c19debb683fd--030811F_276.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/zqL-Qr5ZmG6OrG8SjeOnkOmOLf4=/801a4f70-571f-4b42-97ce-9633f421f24e--030811F_277.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/xr536WSMOmpTZXNSj6a2brgiDD4=/de2de886-70dc-409e-8b3f-f4f72d1468c1--030811F_287.JPG', 'https://images.food52.com/LNRO7ifeSXLzODOqiAi9JBmGNDU=/6300867e-ce45-4132-83b0-968f5a2399b7--030811F_291.JPG']"

Flip brown & cook through on the other side. (The apples and onions can be on top of the chops while they are browning to give flavor.) At this point sometimes (not always, depends how fast they are cooking and how much butter and juice released from apples there is) I add just a teeny bit of water (or apple cider if you have it) and cover to make sure the chops are cooked through and softens the apples if needed.

27220,"Kale, Cabbage, and Brussels Sprout Chopped Salad",Serves: 8 to 10,['This recipe is a Community Pick!'],"['1. Wash and spin dry the kale, and then cut it, plus the Brussels sprouts and the cabbage, in small squares, about 1/4-inch by 1/4 inch. For the kale, it works best to rib the leaves, roll them into fat cigars a few leaves at a time, then chiffonade them. Keeping the slices together and uniform, turn them 90\xc2\xb0 counter clockwise and make even slices lengthwise, about a 1/4-inch apart. (The same method works for the cabbage.)', '2. Halve the Brussels sprouts lengthwise, cut each halve in half, and, with them lying cut-side down on the cutting board, slice them like you would an onion. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stress about technique too much here -- the important part is that everything is roughly the same size -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for you to just chop and mince like you would a pile of herbs, go ahead and do that.', '3. Place all chopped vegetables in a large bowl, add sugar and salt, and massage the greens slightly until they no longer feel raw. This salad will only improve if you do this a few hours ahead of time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary. (At this point, the salad can sit for up to 2 or 3 days. It will lose water, so be sure to drain before continuing on.)', '4. To make the dressing, combine the vinegar, mustard, salt, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender, and blend until the color lightens and everything is combined. (You can also use a whisk and a strong arm for this.) Slowly stream in the olive oil, and then the hazelnut oil, if using -- you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for everything to be thick and emulsified. (This dressing will last for 2 weeks in the fridge.)', '5. Add dressing to greens, a few spoonfuls at a time -- you want a well-dressed salad but not a soggy one. (Keep in mind you will have leftover dressing, so no need to use it all.) Fold in the sesame seeds and pistachios, and serve.']",['https://images.food52.com/C0TRHZM7EghcxoxeIrwXUIB1Yyc=/753x502/e52c9649-7d50-4107-97e5-e16023d91505--untitled_58_of_58-.jpg']
