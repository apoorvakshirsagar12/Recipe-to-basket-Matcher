Lay a large sheet of aluminum foil on a baking sheet. Scrub the beets and lay them on one end of the foil. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt. Fold the foil over the beets to make a packet and roll the edges to seal. Bake until the beets are tender, about 30 minutes. Let sit on the baking sheet until warm but not hot.'),(5696,'2. While the beets are still warm, peel them (I find that pressing against the sides of the beets with your thumb loosens the skins) and slice into 1/2-inch wedges. Add the wedges to a serving bowl as you go.'),(5696,'3. Whisk together the mustard, vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, until the dressing is emulsified. (You can also just throw everything into a jar, screw on the lid tightly and shake until emulsified.)'),(5696,'4.

Grill for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned and cooked through.'),(6094,'2. Chop the plums into small bites. Place all of the ingredients for the reduction in a cast iron pan. You can also use a small saucepan here, but I like my cast iron.'),(6094,'3. Simmer over low-medium heat until the plums are softened and the balsamic is reduced to half. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. The plums will still be chunky when finished.'),(6094,'4. Pour the sauce over the pork chops, and enjoy with good crusty bread.'),(7939,'1. Melt the butter (or heat the olive oil) in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the leeks and a pinch of salt and sauté, stirring occasionally, until the leeks have softened and are beginning to color (about 10 minutes).'),(7939,'2. While the leeks are cooking, wash and peel the sweet potato and parsnips. Grate on the coarse holes of a box grater, and place in a large bowl (if you have no patience for hand-grating, you can use the shredding disk on a food processor, but place about ¼ of the mixture back in the bowl of the processor with the regular blade and pulse a few times). Add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, feta, egg and matzo meal. Stir to combine. Mix in the cooked leeks.'),(7939,'3. Pour the canola oil to a depth of 1/2-inch in a frying pan—you can use the pan used for the leeks, and additional pans if you’d like to make quick work of it. Heat the oil over a medium flame until hot—if you drop in a shred of the latke mixture, it should bubble vigorously. Shape about 3 tablespoons of the latke mixture into a round shape (I like to pack a 1/4 cup measure mostly full), and place in the oil. Flatten slightly to form a small pancake. Repeat as many times as your pan space allows. Cook the latkes until well-browned, 5 to 7 minutes, then flip and brown the other side. These latkes are more delicate than standard potato pancakes (especially when warm), so be delicate. When the second side has cooked, place on a plate lined with brown paper, stacking as needed. If you want to be extra-good, now and then strain out any rogue bits that have floated into the oil before they burn (or leave them in, for a taste closer to what grandma would have made). Serve. Or...'),(7939,'4. If you’re not serving at once, layer the cooled latkes in a sealed container with parchment between the layers, and freeze. To serve, preheat the oven to 375° F. Place the latkes on a cookie sheet (you can place them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet for a crisper result, but usually the sheet is fine for me), and cook until they have colored a bit more and are heated through and sizzling (10 to 15 minutes).'),(8192,'1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Using poultry shears, cut the backbone out of the chicken. Reserve the backbone. Turn the chicken skin-side-up and press down on the breast bone to flatten the chicken.

Set the pan back on the stove. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook over medium heat until the shallot has softened, about 2 minutes. Add the rosemary, sage and sherry. Increase the heat and boil off nearly all the sherry. Add 1 cup chicken broth and the lemon slices. Gently lower the chicken back into the pan, again skin-side up.'),(8192,'4.

Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes -- uncovered, or the skin will soften! Carve the bird. Strain the pan juices and adjust the seasoning. Serve bird and cooked-down broth, and enjoy!'),(8538,'1. Drain beans of their soaking liquid and place in a large kettle with whole onion, and bay leaf.  Fill pot with fresh filtered water to more than cover the beans—1 to 2 inches above the surface of the beans should do.  Season cooking water with salt—enough that you can taste it. Bring the water gently to the boil, stirring occasionally. When water boils, turn heat to medium low and simmer beans until tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Older beans will take longer. You will probably have to top off the beans with more water as they cook. You can remove a few beans from the pot and cut through the center with a sharp knife to test for doneness.'),(8538,'2. In a heavy-bottomed pan, sauté onions until slightly softened; make an opening in the sautéing onions and add a little more oil and  the minced garlic, allowing it to sizzle a bit before stirring into the onions. Sauté mixture until onions are translucent. Quickly add the spices and herbs and stir once or twice into the onion mix to bring out the fragrance then remove from heat before they scorch. Add to the pot of beans along with the canned tomatoes (squeeze over the pot to break them up before adding if they are whole), and orange pieces. Simmer mixture for 1/2 hour or so until flavors blend.  Taste for salt and seasoning and adjust. May be made a day ahead for best flavor.'),(8538,'3.

Add about 1 cup of cold water to the pan, or just enough to reach an 1/8 inch from the tops of the carrots. (Don\'t add more than a 1 1/2 cups to start.)'),(9835,'2. Place the pan over high heat and bring to a boil. The idea here is to have the water all but evaporate at the same time as the carrots finish cooking, leaving you with a rich and delicious glaze to coat and be poured over the dish. If the water seems to be evaporating before the carrots are close to being done, you can add a little more. At the same time, if the carrots seem to be getting too done, remove them from the pan.  Reduce the glaze, and then at the end, add the carrots back to warm them and to cook the lettuce.'),(9835,'3. The whole idea here is to have a tender carrot that is not mushy, yet not so hard that when you cut it, it shoots across the table. It is timing, and you can always use a toothpick to test the fattest part of the carrot—it should yield with pressure. As the water gets close to being gone, add the lettuce. Let the lettuce wilt and get soft (this will only take about 30 seconds). You want it to be vibrant green but tender like cooked spinach. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Plate, drizzle the glaze over the veggies and serve.'),(9906,'1. Cook the carrots in a small amount of salted water until tender, about 5-7 minutes (more if you cut them bigger).'),(9906,'2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium saucepan and add the spices and garlic; cook, stirring, over medium-low heat, until the kitchen starts to smell like Rabat or Marrakesh.'),(9906,'3.

To make vegetarian, use a strong mushroom broth rather than the beef broth.  I wouldn’t use water or a light broth, you need something robust.  For a super quick stew, you can also substitute the giant lima beans for the baby ones, in which case, add the black eyed peas and giant limas at the same time and cook under pressure for 10 minutes then release naturally.  If you are not a chile head and don’t like spicy food, you can substitute smoked paprika for the chipotles.

In a large bowl, toss the cubed lamb with a teaspoon of salt and the spices.'),(14943,'3. In a large stew pot, heat the olive oil. Add the lamb and let it brown for several minutes. Push it aside and add the onion directly to the pan, and cook for a few minutes until it starts to soften and brown. Don\'t be alarmed by the fat and oil that will begin to accumulate in the pan—you want that, trust me. Push the lamb and onions to the side and add the tomato paste directly to the pan. Stir the paste to coat it in fat and oil, and cook until the tomato is caramelized, roughly 5 minutes. Follow your nose—it will smell deep and rich, rather than raw.'),(14943,'4. Add the wine and broth and bring to a simmer, then add the sweet potato. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, then taste and adjust the salt.

Cabbage may splatter if it is still slightly wet. If that happens, turn heat down a bit. Let cabbage cook for about five minutes without disturbing until underside is caramelized. Watch it carefully because you don\'t want it to burn. It should be a lovely golden color, not blackened. When cabbage has caramelized on one side, carefully turn pieces over and continue to cook. You may have to adjust the heat, if necessary. You don\'t want the pieces to cook too quickly. Aim for about five minutes per side.'),(15583,'3. While cabbage is cooking, add walnuts to a pie pan and place in preheated oven. After about five minutes, check on nuts. If they are starting to smell fragrant and are a beautiful golden color, remove from heat. Otherwise, give them another minute or two to finish toasting. Remove from heat. Crumble nuts if pieces look too large. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (you may need less) olive oil to nuts, just to very lightly moisten them. Sprinkle with sea salt and reserve.'),(15583,'4. After the cabbage has been cooking for about five minutes, start cooking your pasta. When blanching water has come to a rolling boil, add pasta. Keep water at a steady boil, adjusting heat if necessary. Give pasta a good stir with a ladle to make sure pasta is not sticking together.'),(15583,'5. Check on cabbage. Once cabbage is caramelized on all sides and is a lovely golden color, add garlic to pan. When you can smell garlic cooking (after about 1 minute), add thyme sprig and chopped sage leaves to pan. Add a ladleful or two of pasta water to pan, lower heat and keep at a simmer while pasta finishes cooking and while you prepare the brown butter.'),(15583,'6. Add 3 ounces of butter to small skillet. Turn heat on burner to medium. Once butter has melted and is a lovely golden color, add 10 whole sage leaves to pan. Turn heat down to medium-low. Stir butter frequently, spooning butter over sage leaves. Watch carefully, you don\'t want the sage leaves (or the butter) to burn. After about 5 minutes, when sage leaves are a slightly darker green and are no longer limp, remove from butter with slotted spoon. They should have a nice crisp texture. If not, return to butter to continue cooking for another minute or two. When sage leaves have crisped, drain on paper towel-lined plate. Continue cooking butter until it is a lovely dark brown color, about another minute or two more. Remove butter from heat.'),(15583,'7. When pasta is almost finished cooking and is still a bit al dente (taste it, if you are in doubt), fish pasta out of saucepan with a spider and add pasta to cabbage mixture in skillet. If there is not much liquid in the pan, add a few more ladlefuls of the cooking liquid. Raise heat to medium, and stir pasta and cabbage together so that the cabbage sauce coats the pasta. Cook for another minute or two until pasta is completely cooked and cabbage sauce has slightly thickened. Remove from heat. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Put a generous amount of pasta and cabbage on each plate or in pasta bowls. Add a generous spoonful of brown butter to each serving of pasta and gently mix with tongs.

Cook the carrots, stirring gently every once in a while, until the slices are soft enough that they can be smushed easily by gently pinching them between your fingers. (This should take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.) If at any point you find that the carrots start to stick to the pan and brown, gently lift them from the bottom of the pan, add a few tablespoons of water and re-cover.'),(19045,'3. When they are very soft, you can serve them as is. Or, if you\'re feeding a baby (or you just like them this way yourself), you can either mash the carrots gently or push them through a fine-mesh sieve before serving them. Make sure to let them cool before you feed them to a baby!'),(19148,'1. Preheat an oven to 425° F. Heat a 10-inch seasoned cast-iron skillet in the oven for 10 minutes, until it\'s very hot.'),(19148,'2. Combine the cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. In a separate, large bowl, whisk together the eggs, yogurt, and maple syrup.'),(19148,'3. Remove the hot skillet from the oven and add the butter, swirling it until it\'s melted (it\'s okay if it slightly browns). Working quickly, pour the hot, melted butter into the egg and yogurt mixture, and whisk until combined. Add the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Pour the batter into the hot skillet and and bake until golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cornbread to slightly cool before cutting.'),(19937,'1. Combine farro with 4 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until grains are nearly tender (about 20 minutes). Add one teaspoon salt, stir and simmer until grains are tender (another 10 minutes or so). Drain excess water, then place grains into a large bowl and allow to cool.'),(19937,'2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss onion with enough oil to lightly coat, but not soak. Spread across a baking sheet and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Toss sweet potato with oil in a similar fashion and spread on a separate sheet pan. Sprinkle with cumin, coriander and a pinch of salt. Place both baking sheets in the oven and roast until vegetables are tender and onions have begun to brown. The onions will be done before the sweet potatoes. Stir and turn vegetables at least once during cooking.'),(19937,'3. When vegetables are nearly done roasting, spread walnuts on a third sheet (or in an oven-safe dish, if you\'ve run out of baking sheets) and toast until they have darkened in color and are fragrant (place your nose close, but not too close, to the pan to take a whiff), about 5 to 8 minutes. Keep a watchful eye on the nuts as they will quickly burn in a hot oven. If you prefer, wait until vegetables have finished cooking and been removed from the oven. Turn the temperature down and toast the nuts. When nuts are done, cool completely, then roughly chop into small pieces.'),(19937,'4. While vegetables and nuts cook, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add kale and garlic and lightly sauté until kale has wilted but is still bright green in color. Stir to cook evenly. Scrape cooked greens mixture into the bowl with farro. Add sweet potato and onion. Fold the ingredients together, then drizzle with a bit of fruity extra virgin olive oil to moisten (a tablespoon or so) plus lemon juice to taste (about one tablespoon, or less if you are using ordinary lemon juice). Taste and add more salt as needed, plus a few grinds of fresh pepper. Gently stir in walnuts and pomegranate seeds.'),(20884,'1. Add the sugar, salt, rosemary and peppercorns to the tea and let cool. (If you\'re pressed for time, brew the tea double strength and cool it down with some ice cubes). Immerse the pork chops in the brine and refrigerate for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If it goes a little longer, that\'s OK.'),(20884,'2. When ready, fire up the grill. Remove the chops form the brine and pat dry. Grill over high heat until you see the sides of the chops beginning to get done, flip, and cook on the other side for the same amount of time, maybe 4-5 minutes a side depending on the heat of your grill. You can check the temperature at this point; the FDA says 145 degrees is good so a little shy of that works fine because they will continue to cook. Remove and let sit for 5-7 minutes before serving with roasted potatoes and something green. If you\'d like an elegant echo, drink some iced oolong with it; if not, Tsingtao is equally lovely.'),(21136,'1. Remove the greens from the beets, wash, and set aside.'),(21136,'10. Bake at 400 until the pastry is golden, the custard is set, and the top is just a little brown.'),(21136,'11. About 5 minutes before you pull the tart out of the oven, heat a small amount of oil in a large saute pan. Roughly chop the beet greens and saute them until wilted, adding salt and pepper to taste. (We liked these served on top of the tart, but you can also serve them as a simple side dish.)'),(21136,'2. Scrub the beets. Most recipies have you roast and then peel your beets, but I peel mine first and then roast them. It\'s easier to handle them when they aren\'t slippery, and I lose less of their delicious flesh. But use your prefered method.'),(21136,'3. Place each beet on a small square of aluminum foil, drizzle with olive oil, and wrap in the foil. Bake at 400 degrees anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your beets. They\'re done when they are knife tender and can be pierced with the tip of a paring knife with ease.'),(21136,'4. Once the beets are knife tender, remove them from the oven and set aside to cool.'),(21136,'5. While the beets cool, roll the puff pastry out until you have a rough 10-inch square. Transfer the sqare to a parchment-lined baking sheet.'),(21136,'6. Roll in the edges of the pastry about an inch on all 4 sides so that you have a delicious pastry wall. Use a little water to seal the edges. You want to make sure that the custard doesn\'t leak out when poured into the \"shell\".'),(21136,'7. Combine the egg and the goat cheese with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Slowly add the milk or cream, stiring until you have a thick but pourable consistency. It should be no thinner than pancake batter.'),(21136,'8. Slice the beets into rounds. You should get 5 or 6 rounds from each beet.'),(21136,'9. Pour the custard into the pastry shell, then lay the beets on top, being careful not to overflow the pastry shell.'),(21426,'1. Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Add the butter, olive oil, and honey. Stir well and add the carrots, fennel, orange zest and fennel seeds. Toss until the slices are well coated with the oil. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the fennel starts to soften. Add the water, orange juice, salt, and pepper. Toss quickly and reduce heat to between medium and medium-low. Cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes until the vegetables are tender.'),(21426,'2. Uncover the pan. Raise heat to high and fast-simmer until the juices have all evaporated and some of the vegetables are golden-brown, about 6 to 7 minutes, tossing only occasionally so as not to break or mush the vegetables. Remove orange zest, transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with the fennel fronds, and serve immediately.\nCook’s\' note: The carrots and fennel can be trimmed and cut up to 6 hours ahead and refrigerated until ready to use, but the dish is best made just before serving. It does not reheat well.'),(22184,'1. In a large skillet, heat one tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and a large pinch of salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until they’ve softened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Push the onion and garlic to one side of the pan, and add the cumin, chili powder, paprika, oregano, and cayenne. Let sizzle in the pan until they’re toasted and fragrant, about 1 minute, then stir well until the onions and garlic are evenly coated with the spices.'),(22184,'2. Add the ground pork to the pan. Cook over medium-high heat, breaking up any large chunks of pork and stirring occasionally, until the pork is just cooked through.  Season with salt to taste. Remove any excess fat from the pan.'),(22184,'3. Add the coconut milk; simmer for about 5 minutes until thickened, then stir in the black beans, pineapple juice and 1 tablespoon lime juice and cook for an additional minute or two. Taste and add more lime juice if needed. Adjust the seasoning to taste. You can serve right away, or cover the pan and let the pork gently simmer over low heat.'),(22184,'4. Using a slotted spoon, divide the ground pork equally among lightly warmed flour tortillas. Serve with lots of avocado and other toppings of your choice.'),(22554,'1. Place the meat in a large casserole dish. In a food processor, grind the walnuts, pome- granate molasses, garlic, and oil into a puree. Add the parsley and pulse into small bits. Pour the marinade over the meat and toss well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.'),(22554,'2. If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak them in salty water for a couple of hours before grilling. Thread 3 or 4 pieces of meat onto each skewer 1/4 inch apart, leaving 2 inches of space at the end. Discard the marinade. Brush or wipe extra marinade from the skewers. Leave the meat out while you heat the grill so it can come up to room temperature (no more than 45 minutes total).'),(22554,'3. Prepare a hot grill.\nLightly oil the grill and grill the kebabs for 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally. When done, the meat should be slightly charred on the outside and very pink on the inside. Transfer to a serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and serve.'),(22554,'4. Vegetarian option: Replace the lamb with 2 pounds tempeh, cubed; 2 pounds vegetables, such as zucchini, red onions, and mushrooms, cubed; or a combination of tempeh and vegetables. Marinate overnight according to the recipe.'),(23089,'1. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and salt the water generously. Simmer the potatoes until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the pan and let them cool.'),(23089,'2. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar with a few big pinches of salt and pepper to taste. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly. Taste and add more salt if you like.'),(23089,'3. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them into 1/2-inch rounds. Arrange the lettuce on a small platter.'),(23089,'4. Put half the vinaigrette in a medium saucepan and set it over medium heat. Once it is hot, add the chicken and potatoes to the pan. Cook, turning everything over gently with a spatula every couple of minutes, until the chicken is warmed through, and both the chicken and potatoes are crisp around the edges.'),(23089,'5. Drizzle a few spoonfuls of the remaining vinaigrette over the lettuce and then arrange the chicken and potatoes over the top. Sprinkle the chives over everything and serve immediately, with the remaining vinaigrette on the side.'),(23946,'1. Preheat oven to 475° F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, gently toss grapes and rosemary with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Roast 13 to 15 minutes or until grapes begin to burst.'),(23946,'2. Meanwhile, heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Add remaining oil to skillet and cook, turning once, until pork chops are just browned on both sides and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set pork aside to rest.'),(23946,'3. Toss grapes with butter and lemon juice. Serve pork and grapes with salad.'),(24330,'1. Place a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven with a lid over medium heat. Add the pancetta and render its fat. You want a gentle render here. You aren\'t trying to crisp the pancetta, just render.'),(24330,'2. Add the butter and, once it has melted, add the onion, celery, garlic, and carrots.  Sweat the vegetables until they are tender, don\'t let them brown. Add the cabbage, bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper. Turn the cabbage to coat the leaves in the fat. Add a quarter cup of water and put the lid on the pot. Reduce the heat to low. Cook the cabbage until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Add a scrape or two of nutmeg, the parsley, and thyme. Stir to combine, then serve.'),(24411,'1. Warm the olive oil in a large pan over medium-low heat, add the garlic and let flavor the oil for 3 to 5 minutes without allowing the garlic to caramelize.'),(24411,'2. Lightly salt and pepper the brussels sprouts in a bowl and toss.'),(24411,'3. Add brussels sprouts, cut side down into the pan. Increase to medium heat. Add the wine and immediately cover for 10 to 15 minutes without disturbing the sprouts.'),(24411,'4. Remove the lid and increase heat to medium high heat. When the liquids have evaporated, sprinkle the pine nuts over the top and add the thyme.'),(24411,'5. Brown the sprouts, leaving them cut side down and then toss over high heat until the nuts and uncut sides of the sprouts have been slightly toasted, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add additional salt and pepper to taste.'),(24411,'6. Serve while warm. Top with Parmesan if desired.'),(24643,'1. Place a large stockpot filled with water to boil on the stove top. Once it comes to a full boil, add the prepared cauliflower and cook until tender, but not too mushy. Drain and rinse with cold water, set aside to cool.'),(24643,'10. I love to serve these after letting them cool as they are much more flavorful at room temperature.\n\nThese are the ideal hostess side dish (plan to make these during the upcoming holidays) that you can make ahead.'),(24643,'11. Store them in a sealed container in the refrigerator and simply deliver them to your host and let them come back to room temperature before serving.'),(24643,'2. Saute the shallots and garlic in olive oil until soft and fragrant; do not brown. Remove from heat and set aside.'),(24643,'3. Break the cooked cauliflower pieces down into very small pieces using your hands or a knife. The cauliflower needs to be solid enough to taste and create texture, but not so large as to not allow the patties to cook properly.'),(24643,'4. Add the eggs, cooked shallots and garlic to the bowl of cauliflower and season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix this well and add some flour and milk to begin creating a batter-like consistency (start with 1/4 cup of each and add more as needed; adjust to get the desired consistency.)'),(24643,'5. Add the grated cheese, shredded mozzarella and chopped fresh parsley to the mix and blend well until combined. Again, test the thickness here and adjust accordingly adding flour and milk until you are satisfied.'),(24643,'6. NOTE: The mixture for these patties is a bit of trial and error as it needs to resemble a very thick pancake batter without being too dry or worse, too thin and runny.'),(24643,'7. Heat a large non-stick skillet to medium-high heat and add drizzle of the light olive oil and test the mixture by spooning a small pattie into the skillet and watch how it cooks and holds its shape.'),(24643,'8. Use your spatula to press and form the pattie in the skillet as it cooks to make sure it maintains shape and cooks through.\n\nAdjust your heat and resist the urge to flip too soon, allow the pattie to cook until light golden brown (about 3-4 minutes each side depending on your stove) before you flip them.'),(24643,'9. Continue forming and cooking the patties, adding more light olive oil as you go. Remove the cooked patties to a large flat platter to cool (do not overlap them until cooled.) Taste the first patties and adjust your salt and pepper seasoning for the remaining batter, if needed.'),(24909,'1. Cut off the greens of the carrots, leaving a half inch of stem.'),(24909,'2. Peel the carrots lightly, and wash them well.'),(24909,'3. Cut the large ones in half lengthwise, but leave small ones whole.'),(24909,'4. Put a pan with 1/2 inch of water in it over high heat.'),(24909,'5. Add the carrots, a small knob of butter per person, and salt to taste.'),(24909,'6. Cover the pan and cook until the carrots are just tender.'),(24909,'7. Remove the lid, lower the heat, add a small spoonful of honey, and cook until the water is mostly gone and the carrots are gilded with a shiny glaze of butter and honey.'),(24909,'8. Remove from the pan and serve right away.'),(24909,'9. If you like, strew some chopped chervil or dill on the top.'),(25519,'1. Heat oven to 400° F.'),(25519,'2. Put olive oil in an ovenproof skillet. (Alternatively, you can brown the shallots in whatever pan you like, and then transfer them into a baking dish).'),(25519,'3. Add the brown sugar, mix to just combine, then add shallots, cut-side down if you\'ve halved any. Brown over medium heat for 10 minutes, flipping once halfway through, or as soon as a beautiful brown crust has developed on the first side.'),(25519,'4. Take the pan off of the heat, and add everything else -- salt, thyme, sherry, vinegar -- shake the pan a bit, and then cover with foil and roast in the oven until completely cooked through. Depending on the size of your shallots, this can take anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes -- test with a knife every 5 minutes beginning at the 25-minute mark.'),(25519,'5. Serve warm.'),(26233,'1. Heat oven to 400° F.'),(26233,'2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, honey, coriander seeds, and caraway seeds.'),(26233,'3. Place carrots and garlic cloves in an even layer in a casserole or other baking dish.  Season generously with kosher salt and pepper. Add the olive oil-honey-spice mixture, and toss well to evenly coat.'),(26233,'4. Roast for about 20 to 30 minutes, or until the carrots and garlic cloves are tender and golden brown. A few times during cooking, toss the carrots and garlic around in the pan to ensure even browning. Once done, remove from oven. Finely chop the roasted garlic.'),(26233,'5. In a small bowl, combine the roasted garlic with the mustard greens, parsley, and lemon zest. Use the back of a fork to evenly incorporate the roasted garlic into the greens.'),(26233,'6. Sprinkle the carrots generously with the mustard greens gremolata.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.'),(27220,'1. Wash and spin dry the kale, and then cut it, plus the Brussels sprouts and the cabbage, in small squares, about 1/4-inch by 1/4 inch. For the kale, it works best to rib the leaves, roll them into fat cigars a few leaves at a time, then chiffonade them. Keeping the slices together and uniform, turn them 90° counter clockwise and make even slices lengthwise, about a 1/4-inch apart. (The same method works for the cabbage.)'),(27220,'2. Halve the Brussels sprouts lengthwise, cut each halve in half, and, with them lying cut-side down on the cutting board, slice them like you would an onion. Don’t stress about technique too much here -- the important part is that everything is roughly the same size -- if it’s easier for you to just chop and mince like you would a pile of herbs, go ahead and do that.'),(27220,'3. Place all chopped vegetables in a large bowl, add sugar and salt, and massage the greens slightly until they no longer feel raw. This salad will only improve if you do this a few hours ahead of time, but it’s not necessary. (At this point, the salad can sit for up to 2 or 3 days. It will lose water, so be sure to drain before continuing on.)'),(27220,'4. To make the dressing, combine the vinegar, mustard, salt, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender, and blend until the color lightens and everything is combined. (You can also use a whisk and a strong arm for this.) Slowly stream in the olive oil, and then the hazelnut oil, if using -- you’re looking for everything to be thick and emulsified. (This dressing will last for 2 weeks in the fridge.)'),(27220,'5. Add dressing to greens, a few spoonfuls at a time -- you want a well-dressed salad but not a soggy one. (Keep in mind you will have leftover dressing, so no need to use it all.) Fold in the sesame seeds and pistachios, and serve.'),(27673,'1. Heat oil in pressure cooker over medium high heat. Once hot add meat, curry powder, and ginger, turning occasionally until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.'),(27673,'2. Add coconut milk, chickpeas, salt (and water to cover if making on normal pot). Mix well, ensuring to get any bits that may have stuck while meat was cooking.'),(27673,'3. Add lid to pressure cooker. Cook until the pot comes to pressure, then reduce to low and cook for 20-25 more minutes. When time\'s up turn off stove, reduce pressure and open lid. Check for salt. Serve warm with rice, naan or paratha.'),(29895,'1. In a large skillet set over low heat, heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil. Stir in the onion and red pepper, cooking until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Add diced carrots and continue to cook for another 5 to 6 minutes, until carrots are slightly soft. Stir in brown rice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and mirin, cooking for 2 to 3 more minutes to fry the rice.'),(29895,'2. Create a large well in the center of the rice and add remaining tablespoon of peanut oil. Whisk the eggs in a bowl, then pour them into the well. Cook the eggs, stirring occasionally, until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds, then serve hot with a sprinkle of cilantro.'),(30799,'1. Throw all the ingredients (minus the ice cubes and the chops) into a saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring until the salt and sugar dissolve. Remove from heat and stir in ice cubes.'),(30799,'2. Once brine is totally cool, place chops in a ziplock bag and allow them to brine in the fridge overnight (about 8 hours). Before cooking, pat them dry and allow them to come to room temp. Cook the same way as the chops above.'),(31451,'1. Seed and slice the peppers as desired. Pack them into a 1 1/2-cup Ball jar. Fill the jar with water, then pour the water into a measuring cup, noting the amount. Pour out half the water and replace it with vinegar (you’ll likely have about 8 ounces of liquid in all).'),(31451,'2. Pour the vinegar and water into a sauce pan. Add the sugar and salt. Bring to a simmer. Immediately pour the liquid over the peppers in the jar. Screw the lid on the jar and let the liquid cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until ready to use (the peppers should be in the liquid at least 24 hours, and will keep for several weeks).'),(31451,'3. Remove the pork from the refrigerator an hour before cooking them and season aggressively with salt and pepper.'),(31451,'4. Preheat your oven to 350° F.'),(31451,'5. Generously coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil over high heat. Just before the oil smokes, add the pork chops and cook until they are nicely seared. Flip them and place the skillet in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until done as desired (they should be semi-firm to the touch -- not squishy, not stiff -- if you want the pork juicy, which I hope you do).'),(31451,'6. While the pork finishes, put the peppers along with half the pickling liquid into a small skillet over medium heat until they’re heated through.'),(31451,'7. When the pork chops are done, remove them to a platter and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve topped with hot vinegar peppers and juices.'),(31495,'1. Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, coriander, cumin, and cinnamon together. Roll the lamb shanks in the flour mixture until they are coated.'),(31495,'10. Season the sauce to taste and pour it over the lamb shanks.'),(31495,'2. Heat a small Dutch oven (3 to 6 quarts) over medium-high heat and sear the lamb shanks on all sides until a good crust forms -- this will take 8 to 10 minutes total.'),(31495,'3. Transfer lamb shanks to a plate and preheat your oven to 325° F.'),(31495,'4. Scrape any crusty bits from the lamb-searing off the bottom of the Dutch oven (don’t discard, just scrape them up to loosen them and prevent them from burning).'),(31495,'5. Place the Dutch oven over medium heat and add the garlic, onion, carrots, celery, rosemary, thyme, and orange zest. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.'),(31495,'6. Stir in the vinegar and cook until it has evaporated slightly and thickened further, about 10 to 12 minutes.'),(31495,'7. Return the lamb shanks to the pot and pour the white wine and chicken stock over them. Season the broth with salt to taste, cover the pot, and place it in the oven until the meat is very tender and falling off the bones, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.'),(31495,'8. Remove the shanks from the pot, covering them with foil to keep them warm, and strain the liquid into a saucepan. Discard the solids.'),(31495,'9. Cook the sauce over medium heat until it has reduced by half (it should yield about 1 1/2 cups). This should take 10 to 15 minutes.'),(31608,'1. Trim the core out of the cabbage and shred it finely into a large glass, ceramic, or stainless steel bowl.'),(31608,'2. Boil the water with the salt. Pour the boiling salted water over the cabbage, and let sit until the water cools, 30 to 60 minutes.'),(31608,'3. Drain the cabbage using a colander. Press down on the colander with a slightly smaller plate in order to force out as much water as possible. Return the drained cabbage to a clean, dry bowl.'),(31608,'4. Put the vinegar and pepper in a small bowl. While whisking, slowly add the oil until blended with the vinegar. Pour the vinaigrette over the cabbage, tossing gently to  distribute evenly. Taste for salt, adding more if needed. The slaw will be ready to eat immediately, though the flavor and texture will mellow and improve if allowed to stand for an hour or more.'),(31608,'5. Variation: Prepare steps 1 through 3 above, then add the following to the cabbage in the bowl: 2 carrots, shredded on the large holes of a box grater; 1 small shallot, minced; 1 bunch arugula, chopped small; and1 to 2 tablespoons fresh marjoram, minced. Then continue with step 4 above.'),(31873,'1. Preheat the oven to 450° F. Put a 9-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to preheat for at least 10 minutes.'),(31873,'2. Run the bacon through a meat grinder or very finely mince it.
